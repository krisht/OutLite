Here are some websites you might want to look into:

https://developer.bluetooth.org/pages/smart-starter-kit.aspx
http://www.p3international.com/products/p4400.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_meter

First website corresponds to Bluetooth development.
The rest deals with electricity meter, which deals with keeping track of the electricity used.

I briefly looked into it, and I'm not sure if we can just include it at low price for our product.

For our prototype, here are some of my suggestions:

1. We first primarily focus on the very basic - I/O system that severes the electricity when Bluetooth is disconnected 
between the outlet and the smartphone.
2. We might want to first make it a physical feature for customers to use the outlet as "smart outlet" or "normal outlet" 
I am not sure if we can get it using apps and stuff, since I am not even sure if we can make an app that will work with the outlet
if it does not run on Wi-Fi.

As for the customer, I think it is best to put it on the Cooper Union group first.
I might try to talk to a person I know at NYU to put it up at their group as well.

We successfully presented for our mid term - good job guys!
After doing the matrix comparison, I feel like low price will have to be one of our "killer" features, 
even if we need to cut off some of the features of our product.
