We're proud to announce that our proof-of-concept works! \n \n The next step is to test the OutLite in the real world. That’s why we’re calling on you, our valued beta testers. \n \n Please follow this link for a sneak-peek of our work: http://goo.gl/grL3wL \n \n Thank you once again for your continued support, \n \n The OutLite Team \n Pranav Joneja, Krishna Thiyagarajan, David Kim, Ihsan Gunay");
