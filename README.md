OutLite
=====================

This repo contains all the work we have done as a group. The Enclosure Design file is a SolidWorks mockup of what the OutLite’s physical form will look like. The ‘outlite site’ folder contains all the HTML/CSS/JavaScript required for our beta launch site: http://outlite.brace.io . The presentation folder consists of the slides and the script for our midterm presentation. And finally, the comparison matrix is an as-of-yet unreleased, internal document that is guiding our design process, helping us keep track of what our competitors offer and how our device matches up. 

Below is a log of all our meetings thus far.

Meeting Log:

Okay so we've confirmed that we can all type! :)

Here's something I've been working on this weekend: http://outlet.pancakeapps.com
Hopefully we can launch it sometime this week so we can get some hype/attention going.

Can we meet on Tuesday at 11am in Room 427? Usually we would all have EID class, so i thought we can use that time together.

Currently looking into Bluetooth Technology development to figure out about price.
We might cut down some features for a cheaper product.

=====================

Website address has been moved to http://outlite.brace.io, after realizing that Facebook blocked the pancakeapps.com for whatever reason (Probably due to security reasons)

Launched the beta site! Posted links on Facebook with different bit.ly and goo.gl addresses, to analyze who clicked the links.

So far got about 300 clicks. We might want to post the links on other college groups as well if possible, to get more clicks and feedback.
