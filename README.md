OutLite
=====================

Okay so we've confirmed that we can all type! :)

Here's something I've been working on this weekend: http://outlet.pancakeapps.com
Hopefully we can launch it sometime this week so we can get some hype/attention going.

Can we meet on Tuesday at 11am in Room 427? Usually we would all have EID class, so i thought we can use that time together.

Website address has been moved to http://outlite.brace.io, after realizing that Facebook blocked the pancakeapps.com for whatever reason (Probably due to security reasons)

Launched the beta site! Posted links on Facebook with different bit.ly and goo.gl addresses, to analyze who clicked the links.

So far got about 300 clicks. We might want to post the links on other college groups as well if possible, to get more clicks and feedback.
